Web Audio School
===

An intro to the **Web Audio API** by a series of self-guided workshops.

We will primarily focus on using the Web Audio API for music, but the concepts here could be applied to game sound and other creative uses.

**WORK IN PROGRESS:** Only Part I is implemented so far!

> This workshop is being built for [CampJS V](http://v.campjs.com/)!
