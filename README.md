Web Audio School
===

**WORK IN PROGRESS:** Nothing is implemented yet!

An intro to the **Web Audio API** by a series of self-guided workshops.

We will primarily focus on using the Web Audio API for music, but the concepts here could be applied to game sound and other creative uses.

5. Add an envelope
6. Modulate pitch with an LFO

## Part II: Working With Samples

7. Decode and play an audio file
8. Set in and out points
