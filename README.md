Web Audio School
===

**WORK IN PROGRESS:** Nothing is implemented yet!

An intro to the **Web Audio API** by a series of self-guided workshops.

We will primarily focus on using the Web Audio API for music, but the concepts here could be applied to game sound and other creative uses.

## TODO

- Lesson selector
- All of the lessons

1. Play a pitched sawtooth wave
2. Play a short sequence of notes
3. Add a high-pass filter
4. Modulate filter cutoff
5. Add an envelope
6. Modulate pitch with an LFO

## Part II: Working With Samples

7. Decode and play an audio file
8. Set in and out points
9. Looping samples
10. Set sample pitch
